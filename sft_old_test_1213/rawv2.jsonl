It happens suddenly and immediately for every 5 liters consumed.\n\u00a0\nPlease complete the following python code precisely:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distanceTraveled(self, mainTank: int, additionalTank: int) -> int:\n```\n    ### Response:\n    \n    To solve this problem, we need to simulate the truck's fuel consumption and fuel transfer from the additional tank to the main tank. The truck's mileage is 10 km per liter, and every 5 liters of fuel used in the main tank, if there is at least 1 liters of fuel in the additional tank, 1 liter will be transferred from the additional tank to the main tank.\n    \n    Here's the complete Python code to implement the solution:\n    \n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def distanceTraveled(self, mainTank: int, additionalTank: int) -> int:\n            total_distance = 0\n            total_fuel = mainTank\n            \n            while total_fuel > 0:\n                # Use 10 km per liter of fuel\n                total_distance += 10\n                total_fuel -= 1\n                \n                # Check if we can transfer fuel from the additional tank\n                if total_fuel == 0 and additionalTank > 0:\n                    # If we can transfer fuel, use 1 liter from the additional tank\n                    total_fuel += 1\n                    additionalTank -= 1\n            \n            return total_distance\n    ```\n    \n    #### Explanation:\n    \n    - **Initialization**: We start with `total_distance` set to 0 and `total_fuel` set to `mainTank`.\n    \n    - **Main Loop**: We simulate the truck's fuel consumption and fuel transfer.\n      - We use 10 km per liter of fuel.\n      - We reduce the `total_fuel` by 1 each time.\n      - If `total_fuel` becomes 0 and `additionalTank` is greater than 0, we transfer 1 liter from the additional tank to the main tank.\n    \n    - **Return**: After the loop, we return the `total_distance`, which represents the maximum distance the truck can travel.\n    \n    This code effectively simulates the truck's fuel consumption and fuel transfer, ensuring that the maximum distance can be calculated accurately.

A good subarray is one that contains exactly one `1`.\n    \n    The key observation is that a good subarray must be split by a `0`. This is because a good subarray must contain exactly one `1`, and a `0` separates good subarrays.\n    \n    Here's how we can approach the problem:\n    \n    1. **Count the Consecutive Zeros:** We'll count the number of consecutive zeros in the array.\n    \n    2. **Count the Number of Good Subarrays:** For each consecutive zero, there are `2^(count-1)` ways to split the subarray into good subarrays.\n    \n    3. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be very large, we'll take the modulo of the result by `10^9 + 7`.\n    \n    Here's the complete implementation:\n    \n    ```python\n    from typing import List\n    \n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfGoodSubarraySplits(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            count_zeros = 0\n            total_ways = 1\n            \n            for num in nums:\n                if num == 0:\n                    count_zeros += 1\n                else:\n                    if count_zeros > 0:\n                        total_ways = (total_ways * (2**count_zeros)) % MOD\n                        count_zeros = 0\n            \n            return total_ways\n    ```\n    \n    #### Explanation:\n    - **Initialization:**\n      - `MOD` is set to `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers efficiently.\n      - `count_zeros` keeps track of the number of consecutive zeros.\n      - `total_ways` accumulates the number of ways to split the array into good subarrays.\n    \n    - **Iterate through the Array:**\n      - If we encounter a `0`, increment `count_zeros`.\n      - If we encounter a `1`, calculate the number of ways to split the current subarray into good subarrays:\n        - `total_ways` is multiplied by `2^count_zeros`, which accounts for the number of ways to split the current subarray.\n        - `count_zeros` is reset to zero.\n    \n    - **Return the Result:**\n      - After processing the entire array, `total_ways` contains the number of ways to split the array into good subarrays.\n      - The result is returned modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers.\n    \n    This solution efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of consecutive zeros and powers of two.

This will help us efficiently process the requests.\n\n2. **Use a Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window to track the number of servers that have received requests within the current time interval.\n\n3. **Maintain a Frequency Map**: Use a frequency map to keep track of how many times each server has received a request.\n\n4. **Iterate over Queries**: For each query, determine the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the time interval [query - x, query].\n\n5. **Update the Frequency Map**: As we move the sliding window, update the frequency map to reflect the current state of the servers.\n\n6. **Calculate the Result**: For each query, count the number of servers that have a frequency of zero.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a frequency map to count the number of requests each server has received\n        frequency = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Initialize a sliding window to track the number of servers that have received requests\n        # within the current time interval\n        window = []\n        \n        # Initialize the result array\n        result = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each query\n        for query in queries:\n            # Remove servers that are outside the current time interval\n            while window and window[0][1] < query - x:\n                server_id, _ = window.pop(0)\n                frequency[server_id] -= 1\n            \n            # Add the current server to the window\n            window.append((logs[0][0], logs[0][1]))\n            frequency[logs[0][0]] += 1\n            \n            # Remove the log that was added to the window\n            logs.pop(0)\n            \n            # Count the number of servers that have received no requests\n            count = sum(1 for freq in frequency.values() if freq == 0)\n            result.append(count)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: We sort the logs by time, which helps us efficiently process the requests.\n- **Sliding Window**: We use a sliding window to track the number of servers that have received requests within the current time interval.\n- **Frequency Map**: We use a frequency map to keep track of how many times each server has received a request.\n- **Result Calculation**: For each query, we count the number of servers that have a frequency of zero, which indicates that they did not receive any requests during the time interval.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the sorted logs and a sliding window to maintain the frequency of requests efficiently.

The BFS ensures we explore all possible cycles starting from each index.\n- **Visited Set**: We use a set to keep track of which indices have been visited to avoid revisiting them.\n- **Cycle Length**: We keep track of the maximum cycle length found during the BFS.\n- **Calculation**: The minimum number of seconds needed to complete the cycle is the maximum cycle length divided by 2, since each second, each element can be replaced with its previous or next element.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the minimum number of seconds needed to make all elements in the array equal by identifying the longest cycle and calculating the minimum number of seconds needed to complete it.

If it does, we'll consider the number of ways to transform the substring `s[i+1:]` and `t[j+1:]` with the same number of operations. If it doesn't match, we'll consider the number of ways to transform `s[i+1:]` and `t[j:]` with one less operation.\n    \n    Here's the complete implementation:\n    \n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfWays(self, s: str, t: str, k: int) -> int:\n            MOD = 10**9 + 7\n            n = len(s)\n            dp = [[[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n            \n            # Base case: If both strings are empty, there's exactly one way to transform them\n            dp[0][0][0] = 1\n            \n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    for l in range(k + 1):\n                        # If s[i] matches t[j], we can either keep it or remove it\n                        if s[i] == t[j]:\n                            # If we keep s[i], we can transform s[i+1:] to t[j+1:] with the same number of operations\n                            dp[i + 1][j + 1][l] += dp[i][j][l]\n                            dp[i + 1][j + 1][l] %= MOD\n                            # If we remove s[i], we can transform s[i+1:] to t[j:] with one less operation\n                            if l > 0:\n                                dp[i + 1][j][l - 1] += dp[i][j][l]\n                                dp[i + 1][j][l - 1] %= MOD\n                        else:\n                            # If s[i] doesn't match t[j], we can only transform s[i+1:] to t[j:] with one less operation\n                            if l > 0:\n                                dp[i + 1][j][l - 1] += dp[i][j][l]\n                                dp[i + 1][j][l - 1] %= MOD\n            \n            # The answer is the number of ways to transform s to t with exactly k operations\n            return dp[n][n][k]\n    ```\n    \n    This solution efficiently computes the number of ways to transform `s` into `t` in exactly `k` operations using dynamic programming.

The key observation is that the movement is constrained to the 8 adjacent cells, and the time is measured in seconds.\n    \n    The approach involves simulating the movement of the robot over time.

We start with the initial position `(sx, sy)` and explore its 8 adjacent cells.\n    - **Time Management**: We keep track of the time using the `t` parameter. Each time we move, we decrement `t` by 1. If `t` becomes negative, it means we've exceeded the time limit, and we return `False`.\n    - **Visited Set**: We use a set to ensure we don't revisit a cell more than once.\n    - **Return**: If we manage to reach the target cell within the time limit, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

For each number, we'll consider two cases:\n    - If the number itself is a perfect square, we can form a new subset by including it.\n    - If the number is not a perfect square, we can form a new subset by including it with the last number in the subset.\n    \n    Here's the complete implementation:\n    \n    ```python\n    from typing import List\n    from math import sqrt\n    \n    class Solution:\n        def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            # Helper function to check if a number is a perfect square\n            def is_perfect_square(x):\n                root = int(sqrt(x))\n                return root * root == x\n            \n            # Initialize dp table\n            dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(len(nums))]\n            dp[0][0] = nums[0]  # Base case: first number is a perfect square\n            max_sum = nums[0]\n            \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                num = nums[i]\n                # If num is a perfect square, we can form a new subset\n                if is_perfect_square(num):\n                    dp[i][0] = num\n                else:\n                    dp[i][0] = num\n                \n                # Check if we can extend the previous subset\n                for j in range(2):\n                    if dp[i-1][j] != 0:\n                        # If the last two numbers in the subset are perfect squares\n                        if j == 1 and is_perfect_square(dp[i-1][j] * num):\n                            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i][1], dp[i-1][j] + num)\n                        # If the last number in the subset is not a perfect square\n                        if not is_perfect_square(dp[i-1][j] * num):\n                            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i][1], dp[i-1][j] + num)\n                \n                # Update the maximum sum\n                max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i][0], dp[i][1])\n            \n            return max_sum\n    ```\n    \n    #### Explanation:\n    - **Initialization**: We initialize `dp[i][j]` to the value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is a perfect square.\n    - **Transition**: For each number, we check if it can be added to the previous subset:\n      - If it's a perfect square, we can form a new subset by including it.\n      - If it's not a perfect square, we can form a new subset by including it with the last number in the subset.\n    - **Maximum Sum**: We track the maximum sum of any subset ending at each index.\n    \n    This approach efficiently computes the maximum sum of a subset that satisfies the conditions.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understanding the Tree Structure**:\n   - The tree is represented as an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`.\n   - The root of the tree is at node `0`.\n\n2. **Understanding the Operations**:\n   - We can pick any node `i`.\n   - Add `values[i]` to our score.\n   - Set `values[i]` to `0`.\n\n3. **Tree Health Condition**:\n   - A tree is considered healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.\n\n4. **Maximizing the Score**:\n   - We want to maximize the score by performing these operations on the tree.\n\n5. **Approach**:\n   - We can use a DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the tree and calculate the sum of values on the path from the root to each leaf node.\n   - For each node, we can consider two paths:\n     - The path from the root to the node.\n     - The path from the node to a leaf.\n   - We can calculate the maximum score by considering the sum of values on these two paths.\n\n6. **Implementation**:\n   - We'll use a DFS to traverse the tree and calculate the sum of values on the path from the root to each leaf node.\n   - For each node, we'll calculate the maximum score that can be obtained by either including the node's value or not.\n   - The maximum score will be the maximum of these two options.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumScoreAfterOperations(self, edges: List[List[int]], values: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(values)\n        \n        # Build the tree as an adjacency list\n        tree = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        for a, b in edges:\n            tree[a].append(b)\n            tree[b].append(a)\n        \n        # DFS to calculate the maximum score\n        def dfs(node, parent):\n            # Initialize the maximum score for the current node\n            max_score_including_node = values[node]\n            max_score_excluding_node = 0\n            \n            # Traverse the children of the current node\n            for child in tree[node]:\n                if child != parent:\n                    # Recursively calculate the maximum score for the child\n                    child_score = dfs(child, node)\n                    \n                    # Update the maximum score including and excluding the current node\n                    max_score_including_node += child_score[0]\n                    max_score_excluding_node = max(max_score_excluding_node, child_score[1])\n            \n            # Calculate the maximum score for the current node\n            max_score_including_node = max(max_score_", "bon_num": 0, "task_id": "maximum-score-after-applying-operations-on-a-tree", "infer_time": 313.7610034942627}

An incremovable subarray is a subarray that, when removed, results in a strictly increasing array.\n    \n    Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n    \n    1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n       - A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n       - A strictly increasing array is an array where each element is strictly greater than the previous element.\n       - An incremovable subarray is a subarray that, when removed, results in a strictly increasing array.\n\n    2. **Approach**:\n       - We will iterate through each possible subarray and check if removing it results in a strictly increasing array.\n       - For each subarray, we will check if removing it results in a strictly increasing array.\n       - If it does, it is an incremovable subarray.\n\n    3. **Implementation**:\n       - We will use two nested loops to iterate over all possible subarrays.\n       - For each subarray, we will check if removing it results in a strictly increasing array.\n       - We will use a helper function `is_increasing` to check if a given subarray is strictly increasing.\n\n    4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n       - The time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the length of the array, due to the three nested loops.\n       - The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.\n\n    5. **Code Implementation**:\n\n        ```python\n        from typing import List\n\n        class Solution:\n            def incremovableSubarrayCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n                def is_increasing(arr):\n                    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                        if arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]:\n                            return False\n                    return True\n\n                count = 0\n                n = len(nums)\n\n                # Iterate over all possible subarrays\n                for i in range(n):\n                    for j in range(i, n):\n                        # Check if removing this subarray results in an increasing array\n                        if is_increasing(nums[:i] + nums[j + 1:]):\n                            count += 1\n\n                return count\n        ```\n\n    This code efficiently counts the number of incremovable subarrays by iterating over all possible subarrays and checking if removing them results in a strictly increasing array.

This gives us the reversed string `s_reversed`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Substrings**: We iterate over all possible substrings of length 2 using a loop. For each substring, we check if it is also present in the reversed string `s_reversed`.\n\n3. **Check for Substring in Reversed String**: We use the `in` operator to check if the substring is present in the reversed string.\n\n4. **Return Result**: If any such substring is found, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for the presence of any substring of length 2 in both the original and reversed string, ensuring that the problem is solved in linear time.

Therefore, we can focus on the cells that are not in the desired state.\n    \n    Here's the complete implementation:\n    \n    ```python\n    from typing import List\n    \n    class Solution:\n        def minimumOperations(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n            m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n            # Set to keep track of cells that need to be changed\n            to_change = set()\n            \n            # Check each cell and add to set if it's not in the desired state\n            for i in range(m):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i > 0 and grid[i][j] == grid[i - 1][j]:\n                        to_change.add((i, j))\n                    if j > 0 and grid[i][j] == grid[i][j - 1]:\n                        to_change.add((i, j))\n            \n            # Initialize the number of operations\n            operations = 0\n            \n            # While there are cells to change\n            while to_change:\n                # Increment the number of operations\n                operations += 1\n                # Set to store cells that will be changed in this operation\n                new_to_change = set()\n                \n                # For each cell to change\n                for i, j in to_change:\n                    # Try to change the cell to the desired state\n                    if i > 0 and grid[i][j] != grid[i - 1][j]:\n                        grid[i][j] = grid[i - 1][j]\n                        new_to_change.add((i, j))\n                    if j > 0 and grid[i][j] != grid[i][j - 1]:\n                        grid[i][j] = grid[i][j - 1]\n                        new_to_change.add((i, j))\n                \n                # Update the set of cells to change\n                to_change = new_to_change\n            \n            return operations\n    ```\n    \n    ### Explanation:\n    \n    - **Initialization**: We start by identifying all cells that are not in the desired state. These cells are added to a set `to_change`.\n    \n    - **Iterative Process**: We perform operations to change the cells in `to_change` to the desired state. For each cell, we try to change it to the value of the cell above or to the right. If the change is successful, the new cell is added to `new_to_change`.\n    \n    - **Termination**: The process continues until no more cells can be changed. The number of operations required is tracked in `operations`.\n    \n    This approach ensures that we minimize the number of operations needed to achieve the desired state by focusing on the cells that need to be changed.

A subarray is special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.\n    \n    Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the solution:\n    \n    1. **Parity Check**: We'll use a helper function `is_special` to determine if a subarray is special.\n    2. **Prefix Sum**: We'll use a prefix sum to efficiently calculate the parity of the numbers in the subarray.\n    3. **Query Processing**: For each query, we'll calculate the parity of the subarray using the prefix sum.\n    4. **Result**: We'll return a list of booleans indicating whether each subarray is special.\n    \n    Here's the complete implementation:\n    \n    ```python\n    from typing import List\n    \n    class Solution:\n        def isArraySpecial(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:\n            # Helper function to check if a subarray is special\n            def is_special(start: int, end: int) -> bool:\n                # Calculate the parity of the subarray\n                parity = (end - start + 1) % 2\n                # Check if the parity is the same as the number of elements\n                return (nums[start] % 2 == parity) and (nums[end] % 2 == parity)\n            \n            # Calculate prefix sum of parity\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)\n            for i in range(len(nums)):\n                prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + (nums[i] % 2)\n            \n            # Process each query\n            result = []\n            for start, end in queries:\n                # Calculate the parity of the subarray\n                subarray_parity = prefix_sum[end + 1] - prefix_sum[start]\n                # Check if the parity is the same as the number of elements\n                result.append(subarray_parity == (end - start + 1) % 2)\n            \n            return result\n    ```\n    \n    #### Explanation:\n    - **Prefix Sum**: We use a prefix sum to efficiently calculate the parity of the numbers in the subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of the parity of the numbers from the start of the array to index `i`.\n    - **Query Processing**: For each query, we calculate the parity of the subarray using the prefix sum. The parity of the subarray is calculated as `prefix_sum[end + 1] - prefix_sum[start]`.\n    - **Result**: If the parity of the subarray is the same as the number of elements in the subarray, the subarray is special.\n    \n    This solution efficiently checks if each subarray is special by leveraging the prefix sum and parity properties.
