The function iterates over all possible divisors, which is bounded by the length of the string.\n  - For each divisor, it checks each group, which is bounded by the length of the string divided by the divisor.\n  - The `count_changes` function is O(n) for a string of length n, which is bounded by the length of the string.\n  - Therefore, the overall complexity is O(n^2), which is manageable for moderate-sized strings.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the minimum number of changes needed to make the string into a semi-palindrome by considering all possible divisors and grouping the string accordingly.\n"}

This allows us to easily find all nodes connected to a given node.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We'll use a dynamic programming table to keep track of the minimum number of operations required to make the weight of every edge on the path from ai to bi equal.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We'll use BFS to explore the tree and calculate the minimum number of operations required to reach each node from the starting node.\n\n4. **Query Processing**: For each query, we'll calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the weight of every edge on the path from ai to bi equal.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperationsQueries(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        # Step 1: Build the tree using an adjacency list\n        tree = defaultdict(list)\n        for u, v, w in edges:\n            tree[u].append((v, w))\n            tree[v].append((u, w))\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize the dynamic programming table\n        dp = [float('inf')] * n\n        dp[0] = 0\n        \n        # Step 3: Use BFS to calculate the minimum number of operations\n        queue = deque([(0, 0)])  # (node, weight)\n        while queue:\n            node, weight = queue.popleft()\n            for neighbor, edge_weight in tree[node]:\n                new_weight = weight + edge_weight\n                if new_weight < dp[neighbor]:\n                    dp[neighbor] = new_weight\n                    queue.append((neighbor, new_weight))\n        \n        # Step 4: Process each query\n        answer = []\n        for ai, bi in queries:\n            if dp[bi] == float('inf'):\n                answer.append(-1)\n            else:\n                answer.append(dp[bi] - dp[ai])\n        \n        return answer\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Tree Representation**: We use a defaultdict to represent the tree as an adjacency list. Each node is mapped to a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the neighbor node and the weight of the edge connecting them.\n\n- **Dynamic Programming Table**: We initialize a list `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the minimum number of operations required to reach node `i` from the starting node (node 0). We initialize `dp[0]` to 0 because it takes no operations to reach itself.\n\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We use a queue to perform BFS. For each node, we explore all its neighbors and update the `dp` table if the new weight is less than the current value.\n\n- **Query Processing**: For each query, we calculate the difference between the weights of the starting and ending nodes. If the ending node's weight is `inf`, it means it's not reachable, so we append `-1` to the answer. Otherwise, we calculate the difference and append it to the answer.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the minimum number of operations required for each query, leveraging the properties of BFS and dynamic programming.\n"}

Increment `max_subarrays` and reset `current_max` to 0.\n\n3. **Return the result**:\n   - After processing all elements, `max_subarrays` will contain the maximum number of subarrays that can be formed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we split the array into subarrays such that the sum of their scores is minimized.\n"}

If an integer cannot be obtained, we need to add a coin of that value to the array.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumAddedCoins(self, coins: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        coins.sort()\n        current_sum = 0\n        added_coins = 0\n        \n        for i in range(1, target + 1):\n            if current_sum < i:\n                # If the current sum is less than the current integer,\n                # we need to add a coin of value i - current_sum\n                added_coins += i - current_sum\n                current_sum += i - current_sum\n            \n            # Check if the current integer can be obtained\n            if current_sum >= i:\n                # If the current sum is greater than or equal to the current integer,\n                # we can obtain this integer by considering the coins in the array\n                current_sum += i\n        \n        return added_coins\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting**: We first sort the `coins` array to make it easier to process.\n\n2. **Greedy Approach**:\n   - We iterate over integers from `1` to `target`.\n   - For each integer, we check if it can be obtained by considering the coins in the array.\n   - If the current sum `current_sum` is less than the current integer `i`, we need to add a coin of value `i - current_sum` to the array.\n   - We update `current_sum` by adding the new coin.\n\n3. **Return Result**: After processing all integers, we return the total number of coins added.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines the minimum number of coins needed to ensure every integer in the range `[1, target]` is obtainable.\n"}
{"task_id": 3235, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost to convert the string `source` to the string `target` using the given operations. The operations are defined by the `original` and `changed` arrays, and the cost of changing a character from `original[i]` to `changed[i]` is `cost[i]`.\n\nThe approach involves using a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. We'll use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to convert the first `i` characters of `source` to the first `j` characters of `target`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, source: str, target: str, original: List[str], changed: List[str], cost: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(source)\n        m = len(target)\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to map original characters to their changed counterparts\n        # and their corresponding costs\n        cost_map = {}\n        for i in range(len(original)):\n            if original[i] in cost_map:\n                if cost[i] < cost_map[original[i]][0]:\n                    cost_map[original[i]] = (cost[i], changed[i])\n            else:\n                cost_map[original[i]] = (cost[i], changed[i])\n        \n        # Initialize the dp array\n        dp = [[float('inf')] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n        dp[0][0] = 0\n        \n        # Fill the dp table\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            for j in range(1, m + 1):\n                # If the characters match, copy the cost from the previous state\n                if source[i - 1] == target[j - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n                # If the characters don't match, try to change the source character\n                else:\n                    if source[i - 1] in cost_map:\n                        # If changing the source character is possible\n                        new_cost, new_char = cost_map[source[i - 1]]\n                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + new_cost)\n                    # If changing the source character is not possible, it's impossible\n                    else:\n                        dp[i][j] = float('inf')\n        \n        # The result is the minimum cost to convert the entire source to the target\n        return dp[n][m] if dp[n][m] != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Cost Map Creation**: We create a dictionary `cost_map` that maps each original character to its corresponding changed character and the cost of changing it. This helps us efficiently check if changing a character is possible and what the cost would be.\n\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize the `dp` array with `dp[i][0]` and `dp[0][j]` as infinity for all `i` and `j`. This is because converting an empty string to any other string is impossible, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - For each character in `source`, we check if it matches the corresponding character in `target`. If they match, we copy the cost from the previous state.\n   - If they don't match, we check if changing the source character is possible. If it is, we calculate the cost of changing it and update the current state.\n   - If changing the source character is not possible, we set the current state to infinity.\n\n4. **Result**: The result is the minimum cost to convert the entire `source` to the `target`, which is stored in `dp[n][m]`. If this value is infinity, it means it's impossible to convert, so we return `-1`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the minimum cost using dynamic programming, leveraging the given constraints and constraints on the operations.\n"}

If either of these conditions is true, the edge is part of at least one shortest path.\n\n5. **Answer Array**: Finally, we return an array `answer` where each element is `True` if the corresponding edge is part of at least one shortest path, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds all shortest paths and determines which edges are part of them, making it suitable for large graphs.\n"}
