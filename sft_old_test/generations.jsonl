We iterate over the sorted array and count the number of consecutive elements that are more than 1 apart.\n\n4. **Accumulate Result**: For each subarray, we calculate its imbalance number and add it to the total imbalance.\n\nThis solution is efficient for small arrays, but it's not efficient for large arrays due to the nested loops and sorting. A more efficient approach would involve using a more efficient data structure or algorithm for calculating the imbalance number.\n"}

A good subarray is one that contains exactly one `1`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Count the Consecutive Zeros**: First, we need to count the number of consecutive zeros in the array. This helps us determine the number of ways to split the array into good subarrays.\n\n2. **Count the Groups of Ones**: Once we have the number of consecutive zeros, we can count the number of groups of ones. Each group of ones can be split into subarrays.\n\n3. **Calculate the Result**: The result is the product of all the group sizes, which is the number of ways to split the array into good subarrays.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the modulo of the result with `10^9 + 7`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfGoodSubarraySplits(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        # Count the number of consecutive zeros\n        consecutive_zeros = 0\n        first_one_index = -1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if nums[i] == 1:\n                if first_one_index == -1:\n                    first_one_index = i\n                consecutive_zeros = 0\n            else:\n                consecutive_zeros += 1\n        \n        # If there is no 1 in the array, return 0\n        if first_one_index == -1:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Count the number of groups of ones\n        groups_of_ones = 0\n        for i in range(first_one_index + 1, n):\n            if nums[i] == 1:\n                groups_of_ones += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the result\n        result = 1\n        for _ in range(groups_of_ones):\n            result = (result * 2) % MOD\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Consecutive Zeros Count**: We iterate through the array and count the number of consecutive zeros. When we encounter a `1`, we reset the count and record the first index of the first `1`.\n\n- **Groups of Ones Count**: Once we have the first index of the first `1`, we count the number of groups of ones. Each group of ones can be split into subarrays.\n\n- **Result Calculation**: We calculate the result by multiplying `2` for each group of ones. This is because each group of ones can be split into any subarray, including the empty subarray.\n\n- **Modulo Operation**: We apply the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the range of `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of binary arrays and the properties of consecutive zeros and groups of ones.\n"}

This allows us to easily traverse the tree and find all paths from a node.\n\n2. **Prime Check**: We define a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.\n\n3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function recursively traverses the tree, starting from a given node. It returns two values:\n   - `count`: The number of valid paths starting from the current node.\n   - `paths`: The number of paths starting from the current node.\n\n4. **Initial Call**: We start the DFS from node 0, assuming that the tree is rooted at 0.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The function returns the total number of valid paths starting from node 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently counts valid paths in the tree by leveraging the properties of prime numbers and DFS traversal.\n"}

We also initialize a `visited` grid to keep track of which pixels have been processed.\n\n2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from the given `(i, j)` coordinates. It marks the current pixel as visited and calculates the sum of intensities of all pixels in the current region.\n\n3. **Region Calculation**: For each pixel, we check its 8 adjacent neighbors (excluding itself). If the difference in intensity is within the threshold, we recursively call `dfs` on that neighbor.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all pixels in the current region, we calculate the average intensity of the region and store it in the `result` grid. If the current pixel does not belong to any region, its intensity is copied directly to the `result` grid.\n\n5. **Iterate Over the Image**: We iterate over each pixel in the image and call `dfs` if the pixel has not been visited yet. This ensures that each pixel is processed exactly once.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the average intensity of regions in the image, handling cases where a pixel belongs to multiple regions.\n"}
