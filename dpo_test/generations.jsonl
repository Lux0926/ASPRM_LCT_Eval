{"task_id": 2832, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve the problem of finding the longest possible equal subarray after deleting at most `k` elements, we can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window of equal numbers and dynamically adjust its size by potentially reducing the number of elements outside the window. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        \n        # This will store the count of each number in the current window\n        count = defaultdict(int)\n        max_length = 0\n        left = 0\n        \n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            # Increase the count of the current number\n            count[nums[right]] += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the maximum length of the current equal subarray\n            max_count_in_window = max(count.values())\n            \n            # If the number of changes needed (which is the current window size minus the most frequent number)\n            # is greater than k, shrink the window from the left\n            while (right - left + 1) - max_count_in_window > k:\n                count[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Update the maximum length of the equal subarray found so far\n            max_length = max(max_length, max_count_in_window)\n        \n        return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We use a `count` dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number within the current window.\n   - `max_length` is initialized to zero to keep track of the longest subarray length found.\n   - `left` is the left boundary of the sliding window.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**:\n   - For each element `nums[right]`, we add it to the `count` and then determine the `max_count_in_window`, which is the maximum frequency of any number in the current window.\n\n3. **Maintain Window Size**:\n   - If the size of the current window (`right - left + 1`) minus the `max_count_in_window` exceeds `k`, it means we need to reduce the size of the window by incrementing the `left`. We adjust the count of `nums[left]` accordingly.\n\n4. **Update Maximum Length**:\n   - After adjusting the window size, update `max_length` with the `max_count_in_window`.\n\n5. **Return Result**:\n   - Finally, return `max_length`, which holds the length of the longest possible equal subarray that can be formed after at most `k` deletions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the solution by dynamically adjusting the size of the considered subarray while maintaining its equality.\n"}

Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the maximum subarray sum where we can skip the penalty for starting at position 0.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Identify Two Possible States:**\n   - Either you can start with an even number (`nums[0] % 2 == 0`).\n   - Or you can start with an odd number.\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Scores for Each State:**\n   - For even starting numbers, find the maximum subarray sum where all numbers are even.\n   - For odd starting numbers, find the maximum subarray sum where all numbers are odd.\n\n3. **Return the Maximum of the Two:**\n   - The answer will be the maximum of the two calculated maximum subarray sums.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxScore(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        # Initial score is the score from starting at position 0\n        max_score = nums[0]\n        \n        # Track the maximum score for when we start with an even or odd number\n        max_even_score = nums[0] if nums[0] % 2 == 0 else -float('inf')\n        max_odd_score = nums[0] if nums[0] % 2 == 1 else -float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            # If the current number is even\n            if nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n                max_even_score = max(max_even_score, nums[i] + (i-1 if i > 1 else 0))\n            # If the current number is odd\n            else:\n                max_odd_score = max(max_odd_score, nums[i] + (i-1 if i > 1 else 0))\n        \n        # The answer is the maximum of the two possible scores\n        max_score = max(max_even_score, max_odd_score)\n        \n        # Consider the parity penalty if it's beneficial\n        if max_even_score < max_odd_score:\n            max_score = max(max_score, max_odd_score - x)\n        else:\n            max_score = max(max_score, max_even_score - x)\n        \n        return max_score\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We initialize `max_score` with `nums[0]` because that's the score we get from starting at position 0.\n- We maintain `max_even_score` and `max_odd_score` to track the maximum subarray sum for even and odd starting numbers.\n- As we iterate through the array, we update these scores based on the current number's parity.\n- After processing all elements, we determine the best starting point by comparing `max_even_score` and `max_odd_score`.\n- Finally, we consider the penalty of moving from an even to odd or odd to even and adjust the result accordingly.\n"}

This allows us to prioritize the most profitable items first.\n\n2. **Use Greedy Approach**: We'll select the most profitable items without looking ahead. We'll also keep track of the categories we've included to ensure uniqueness of categories in our subsequence.\n\n3. **Handle Duplicates Effectively**: If we encounter a category that's already included, we'll consider using a previously included item with the same category to reduce the number of distinct categories. This is done by keeping track of items that can be used as \"duplicates.\"\n\n4. **Calculate Elegance**: As we build our subsequence, calculate the elegance after each addition.

The `group_size` starts from 1 and increases with each new group.\n\n- **Limit Checking**: For each number's usage limit, we calculate how many numbers can be added to the current group (`can_add`).

If the current sum plus the next integer (`n+1`) would make it impossible to maintain the beautiful array condition, adjust the current sum by skipping `n+1`.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumPossibleSum(self, n: int, target: int) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        result = 0\n        used = set()\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            # If i is already used, continue\n            if i in used:\n                continue\n            \n            # Calculate the potential new sum if i is included\n            potential_sum = result + i\n            \n            # Check if adding i would violate the condition\n            if 2 * i - target > 0 and 2 * i - target not in used:\n                # Skip i + 1 to maintain the beautiful array condition\n                continue\n            \n            # Add i to the result and mark it as used\n            result = potential_sum\n            used.add(i)\n        \n        return result % mod\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We iterate over numbers from 1 to `n`.\n- We check if the current number `i` is already used. If so, we skip it.\n- We calculate the potential sum if `i` is included.\n- We check if adding `i` would violate the condition by seeing if `target - i` is already in `used`. If it is, we skip `i + 1`.\n- We update the `result` and mark `i` and `i + 1` as used if necessary.\n- We return the accumulated `result` modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we construct a beautiful array with the minimum possible sum.\n"}

If it is, union it with its neighbors.\n    - After processing all nodes, count the number of components for each root representing a component, and check if the component sum is divisible by `k`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxKDivisibleComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], values: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        parent = list(range(n))\n        rank = [0] * n\n        \n        def find(x):\n            if parent[x] != x:\n                parent[x] = find(parent[x])\n            return parent[x]\n        \n        def union(x, y):\n            rootX = find(x)\n            rootY = find(y)\n            if rootX != rootY:\n                if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:\n                    parent[rootY] = rootX\n                elif rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:\n                    parent[rootX] = rootY\n                else:\n                    parent[rootY] = rootX\n                    rank[rootX] += 1\n        \n        # Process nodes with values divisible by k\n        for i in range(n):\n            if values[i] % k == 0:\n                for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                    if values[j] % k == 0 and (values[i] + values[j]) % k == 0:\n                        union(i, j)\n        \n        # Count the components\n        component_count = {}\n        for i in range(n):\n            root = find(i)\n            if root not in component_count:\n                component_count[root] = 0\n            component_count[root] += values[i]\n        \n        # Find the maximum number of components with sum divisible by k\n        max_components = 0\n        for root in component_count:\n            if component_count[root] % k == 0:\n                max_components += 1\n        \n        return max_components\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Union-Find**: We use the `find` function to find the root of a node, and `union` to connect components.\n- **Component Sum Calculation**: We maintain a dictionary `component_count` to keep track of the sum of values in each component.\n- **Counting Valid Components**: Finally, we iterate over the component sums and count how many are divisible by `k`. This gives us the maximum number of valid components.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the result in `O(n\u03b1(n))` time complexity, where `\u03b1` is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very close to constant for sufficiently large `n`.\n"}

This gives us a 2D list `shortest_distances` where `shortest_distances[i][j]` is the shortest path from node `i` to node `j`.\n\n- **Dynamic Programming for Queries**: For each query, we iterate over all nodes and check if there is a path from the start node (`a`) to the current node and from the node to the end node (`b`). We then calculate the sum of these paths and choose the minimum as the result for that query. If no such path exists, we return `-1`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the required results by leveraging the properties of BFS and dynamic programming, making it suitable for large trees and queries.\n"}
{"task_id": 3080, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping subarrays where the sum of their bitwise AND operations is minimized. The key observation is that the AND operation is maximized when each element in the subarray has the same bitwise AND value. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to split the array into subarrays where each element has the same bitwise AND value.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Maximum Bit Length:** Determine the maximum bit length of any number in the array. This is because if you have a number with a particular bit set (e.g., the 3rd bit is set in a 32-bit integer), you can ensure that this bit is shared across all numbers in the subarray.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Each Bit Position:** For each bit position from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, count how many numbers have this bit set. If there are `n` numbers with a bit set at a particular position, you can form `n` subarrays where each contains one number with this bit set.\n\n3. **Count Maximum Subarrays:** By iterating through each bit position and counting how many numbers have each bit set, we can determine the maximum number of subarrays that can be formed.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        max_bits = 0\n        for num in nums:\n            max_bits = max(max_bits, num.bit_length())\n        \n        max_subarrays = 0\n        for bit in range(max_bits):\n            count_ones = 0\n            for num in nums:\n                if num & (1 << bit):\n                    count_ones += 1\n            max_subarrays += count_ones\n        \n        return max_subarrays\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`max_bits`:** This variable determines the maximum bit length needed to represent any number in the array.\n- **Bit Iteration:** For each bit position from `0` to `max_bits - 1`, we count how many numbers have this bit set.\n- **`count_ones`:** This variable accumulates the number of numbers with the current bit set.\n- **`max_subarrays`:** This variable keeps track of the total number of subarrays that can be formed, which is the sum of `count_ones` across all bit positions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we split the array optimally to minimize the sum of bitwise AND operations on these subarrays.\n"}

If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` satisfy the condition `nums[i] > nums[j]`, then they can be removed together.\n\n4. **Update DP Table**: For each pair `(j, i)` where the condition is satisfied, update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[j]`.\n\n5. **Result**: The answer will be stored in `dp[n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.\n\nHere's the complete code implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minLengthAfterRemovals(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        \n        # dp[i] means the minimum length of the array after removing elements from the first i+1 elements\n        dp = [0] * n\n        dp[0] = 1  # Base case: the array with one element is of length 1\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            dp[i] = 1  # Initialize to the minimum possible length of 1\n            for j in range(i):\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    # We can remove nums[i] and nums[j] together\n                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j])\n        \n        return dp[-1]\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.minLengthAfterRemovals([1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nThis code efficiently calculates the minimum length of the array after any number of allowed operations by iterating through all possible pairs of elements and checking their relationship.

{"task_id": 3106, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve the problem of finding the longest subsequence in the given array that sums up to the target, we can use a dynamic programming approach.

The key is the sum, and the value is the length of the subsequence.\n   - `current_sum` is a running sum of the numbers we process in the loop.\n   - `max_length` tracks the length of the longest subsequence found so far.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**:\n   - For each number `num` in `nums`, update `current_sum` by adding `num`.\n   - Check if `current_sum - target` exists in `dp`. If it does, it means we can form a subsequence that sums up to `target` by removing some prefix of the current subsequence. Update `max_length` accordingly.\n\n3. **Update the DP table**:\n   - If `current_sum` is not already in `dp`, add it with the current subsequence length (`max_length + 1`).\n   - If `current_sum` is already in `dp`, update its value with the maximum of the current and the stored value.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large arrays.\n"}

For each node `i`, `graph[i]` contains a list with its single outgoing edge `edges[i]`.\n\n- **DFS with Stack**: We use a stack-based DFS to explore the graph. The stack stores tuples of the form `(current_node, depth)`, where `depth` helps us track the distance from the starting node.\n\n- **Counting Visited Nodes**: We maintain a `visited` set to keep track of nodes we've already processed. For each node, we increment the `count`, which represents the number of nodes visited.\n\n- **Result Collection**: We repeat the process for each starting node `start` (0 to n-1), and collect the `count` for each starting node in the `result` list.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the directed graph traversal and counts the unique nodes visited for each starting node.\n"}

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the effect of swaps:**\n   - When swapping two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, the absolute difference |nums[i] - nums[j]| can be reduced if one of the elements is close to the limit and the other is far from it.\n   - This is because swapping can increase the smaller element and decrease the larger element, thus potentially increasing the difference.\n\n2. **Algorithm:**\n   - Use a sliding window approach to track the minimum and maximum values within each window of size `limit` or less.\n   - For each window, choose the smallest minimum and the largest maximum.\n   - Replace the elements in the window with these chosen values to minimize the lexicographical order.\n\n3. **Implementation:**\n   - Use a deque to efficiently manage the current window and track the minimum and maximum values.\n   - Iterate through the array, updating the minimum and maximum values and swapping elements to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        result = [0] * n\n        min_deque = deque()\n        max_deque = deque()\n        \n        left = 0\n        for right in range(n):\n            # Maintain the min deque: remove elements from the back if they are not in the window\n            while min_deque and min_deque[-1] > nums[right]:\n                min_deque.pop()\n            min_deque.append(nums[right])\n            \n            # Maintain the max deque: remove elements from the back if they are not in the window\n            while max_deque and max_deque[-1] < nums[right]:\n                max_deque.pop()\n            max_deque.append(nums[right])\n            \n            # If the current window size is greater than limit, move the left pointer\n            while right - left + 1 > limit:\n                if min_deque[0] == nums[left]:\n                    min_deque.popleft()\n                if max_deque[0] == nums[left]:\n                    max_deque.popleft()\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Choose the smallest min and largest max within the current window\n            result[right] = min(min_deque[0], max_deque[0])\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis code efficiently finds the lexicographically smallest array by using sliding window techniques with deques to track the minimum and maximum values within each allowed window. The time complexity is O(n) due to the single pass through the array, and the space complexity is O(limit) due to the deques storing at most `limit` elements at any time.\n"}

{"task_id": 3235, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost required to transform the string `source` into the string `target`, using the given operations. Each operation allows us to change a single character from one character to another, with a cost associated with each possible change.\n\nThe approach involves using dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**:\n    - We have a list of allowed character changes, where each change has a cost.\n    - We need to find the minimum cost to transform `source` into `target`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n    - We'll use a dynamic programming table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to transform the first `i` characters of `source` into the first `j` characters of `target`.\n    - Initialize `dp[0][j]` to 0 since there are no characters to transform.\n    - For each character in `source`, iterate over `target` and calculate the minimum cost using the allowed changes.\n    - If no direct match is found, we can skip a character in `source` and match it to any character in `target`, incurring a cost.\n\n3. **Handling Costs**:\n    - Use a map to store the allowed changes and their respective costs.\n    - For each character in `source`, check if there's a corresponding character in `target` that can be changed to, using the stored costs.\n\n4. **Handling Impossibility**:\n    - If at any point, it becomes impossible to transform a segment of `source` into a segment of `target` (i.e., no valid change path), mark it with a large number to indicate that it's unreachable.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n    - The answer will be stored in `dp[len(source)][len(target)]`.

If the distance between two indices is less than or equal to that distance, it means the substring between those two indices is valid.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countSubstrings(self, s: str, c: str) -> int:\n        # Find all indices where the character c appears\n        indices = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == c]\n        \n        # Initialize the count of substrings\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each index where the character c appears\n        for i in indices:\n            # Consider all characters as potential ends of the substring\n            for j in range(len(s)):\n                # Check if the substring from index i to j is valid\n                if (j - i <= i) and all(s[k] == c for k in range(i, j + 1)):\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Identifying Indices**: We use a list comprehension to find all indices where the character `c` appears in the string `s`.\n  \n- **Counting Valid Substrings**: For each index where `c` appears, we iterate over every possible end index `j` in the string. If the substring from index `i` to `j` is valid (i.e., starts and ends with `c`), and the distance between them is no more than `i`, we increment the count.\n\n- **Validity Check**: The condition `(j - i <= i)` ensures that the substring does not exceed the starting index `i`. The `all(s[k] == c for k in range(i, j + 1))` checks if all characters in the substring are `c`.\n\nThis solution works efficiently and checks each possible substring that starts and ends with `c`.\n"}

We adjust the size of this window dynamically using two pointers (`left` and `right`):\n  - If the current window is valid (i.e., all characters in it have frequencies within `k` of the frequency of the character at `k`), we calculate the number of deletions and update the minimum deletions found so far.\n  - If the window is no longer valid, we increment `left` to reduce the size of the window.\n\n- **Result**: The minimum number of deletions found during the iterations is returned as the result. This ensures we delete the minimum number of characters to make the string k-special.\n"}

The median is a critical element in determining the \"typical\" or \"average\" value in a sorted list.

If `k` is equal to the median, we don't need any operations, so return 0.\n\n2. **Handle the Case where k is the Median**: If `k` is the median, we need to adjust the elements to make it equal to `k`.\n\n3. **Calculate Operations**:\n   - If `k` is greater than the median, calculate the number of operations needed to decrease elements to bring the median closer to `k`.\n   - If `k` is less than the median, calculate the number of operations needed to increase elements to bring the median closer to `k`.\n\n4. **Return the Total Operations**: Sum the operations required for both scenarios and return the minimum value.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperationsToMakeMedianK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        n = len(nums)\n        median = nums[n // 2] if n % 2 != 0 else (nums[n // 2 - 1] + nums[n // 2]) / 2\n        \n        if median == k:\n            return 0\n        \n        operations = 0\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            if num < k:\n                diff = k - num\n                if diff % 2 == 0:\n                    # If the difference is even, we need to decrease by an even amount\n                    operations += diff // 2\n                else:\n                    # If the difference is odd, we need to decrease by an odd amount\n                    # We can achieve this by decreasing by 1 and then increasing by an even amount\n                    operations += (diff // 2) + 1\n            else:\n                diff = num - k\n                if diff % 2 == 0:\n                    # If the difference is even, we need to increase by an even amount\n                    operations += diff // 2\n                else:\n                    # If the difference is odd, we need to increase by an odd amount\n                    # We can achieve this by increasing by 1 and then decreasing by an even amount\n                    operations += (diff // 2) + 1\n        \n        return operations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: We start by sorting the array `nums`. This helps us easily access the median regardless of its parity (odd or even number of elements).\n\n- **Calculating the Median**: After sorting, the median can be determined by checking if the number of elements is odd or even. For odd length arrays, the median is the middle element. For even length arrays, it's the average of the two middle elements.\n\n- **Determining Operations**: For each element in the array, we calculate the difference between `k` and the element. If the difference is odd, we increment the operations by `(diff // 2) + 1` to ensure that the median becomes `k` by either increasing or decreasing by an odd amount. If the difference is even, we increment the operations by `diff // 2`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the minimum operations needed to make the median equal to `k`.\n"}

Since the elements in both arrays can be negative, we need to consider the absolute difference between the individual elements to determine the contribution of each element's difference to the total difference.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def addedInteger(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the sum of both arrays before transformation\n        sum1 = sum(nums1)\n        sum2 = sum(nums2)\n        \n        # Calculate the difference between the sums\n        diff = sum2 - sum1\n        \n        # Since the elements can be negative, we need to consider the absolute difference\n        # between the elements to find the contribution of each element's difference\n        for num1, num2 in zip(nums1, nums2):\n            if num2 > num1:\n                diff -= (num2 - num1)\n            elif num1 > num2:\n                diff += (num1 - num2)\n        \n        # The difference divided by 2 is the integer x\n        return diff // 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of both `nums1` and `nums2`.\n- **Difference Calculation**: We find the difference between the sums. This difference is `2x`, where `x` is the integer we are looking for.\n- **Element Difference**: For each pair of corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, if `num2` is greater than `num1`, we subtract `(num2 - num1)` from the difference. This accounts for the increase in `num1` to make it equal to `num2`. If `num1` is greater, we add the difference (`num1 - num2`) to account for the decrease in `num1`.\n- **Final Step**: Finally, we divide the resulting difference by 2 to get `x`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the required integer `x` in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the arrays.\n"}
